# 👋 Hi, I’m Adéwùmí  
- 😄 **Pronouns:** she/her  
- I’m a **cloud engineer** with a background in web development and a growing passion for cloud infrastructure, automation, and DevOps.  
- I enjoy learning by building, so feel free to explore my projects.
- When you are ready, let’s collaborate on **DevOps projects**, **automation scripts**, or **documentation** that helps others learn.  
- A **Fun fact** about me: I respond to emails faster than DMs — so reach out to me [📫 _here_](mailto:adewumi0110@gmail.com) if you’ve got a cool idea, would love to work with me, or just want to geek out.  
- Or maybe your curiosity led you to my [💼 _LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adewumi-ajibade)? Well, welcome 😄.  
- …and oh! Don’t leave just yet — you might enjoy my technical articles on [✍️ _Medium_](https://medium.com/@Adewuumii) too.  
> That’s all for now — don’t be a stranger! 👋
